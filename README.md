## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icon library

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to structure a landing page with alternating feature blocks using Bootstrap and Font Awesome. The use of Bootstrap's grid system and components facilitated the responsive design, making it compatible with various screen sizes.

```html
<!-- Example Bootstrap Grid System -->
<div class="row align-items-center">
  <div class="col-lg-4 order order-lg-2">
    <!-- Content for the right side on larger screens -->
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-8 order order-lg-1">
    <!-- Content for the left side on larger screens -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to further enhance my skills in responsive design and explore advanced CSS techniques. Additionally, I plan to delve into JavaScript for more interactive elements on web pages.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - Comprehensive guide to using Bootstrap.
- [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons) - A collection of free icons for use in web projects.
